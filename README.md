# Curated Tiers
---
## Background and overview

[Live site](https://curated-tiers.herokuapp.com/#/)

CuratedTiers solves the problem of decision fatique by sorting through product search results from Amazon into three pricing tiers, Value, Mid-Tier, and High-End. We rank the results of each tier by a combination of ratings and number of reviews. This way, you are able to shop with ease by picking the best product for your suited price range.

We have also made shopping fun with the SurpriseMe tab that allows you to search for the most popular products on Amazon along with other shopping categories that will...Surprise You!

Best of all, we have the Deals tab that scans Amazon for the best deals of the day and presents the results ordered by ratings--perfect for all you bargain hunters out there.
